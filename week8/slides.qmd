# ARIMA models

## ARIMA models

\begin{tabular}{@{}rl}
\textbf{AR}: & autoregressive (lagged observations as inputs)\\
\textbf{I}: & integrated (differencing to make series stationary)\\
\textbf{MA}: & moving average (lagged errors as inputs)
\end{tabular}

###
An ARIMA model is rarely interpretable in terms of visible data structures like trend and seasonality. But it can capture a huge range of time series patterns.

# Stationarity

## Stationarity
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf
\begin{block}{Definition}
If $\{y_t\}$ is a stationary time series, then for all $s$, the distribution of $(y_t,\dots,y_{t+s})$ does not depend on $t$.
\end{block}\pause\vspace*{-0.3cm}

Transformations help to **stabilize the variance**.\newline
For ARIMA modelling, we also need to **stabilize the mean**.

# Differencing

### Differencing

* Differencing helps to **stabilize the mean**.
* First differencing: *change* between consecutive observations: $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$.
* Seasonal differencing: *change* between years: $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-m}$.

## Your turn

1. Does differencing make the Closing stock price series stationary for Amazon and Apple stocks?
2. What sorts of transformations and differencing are needed to make the `Gas` series from `aus_accommodation` stationary?


## Automatic differencing
\fontsize{13}{16}\sf
Statistical tests to determine the required order of differencing.

  1. Augmented Dickey Fuller test: null hypothesis is that the data are \alert{non-stationary} and non-seasonal.
  2. Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test: null hypothesis is that the data are \alert{stationary} and non-seasonal.

\only<2>{\begin{textblock}{4}(10.2,3.1)
\begin{alertblock}{}
H$_0$: non-stationary
\end{alertblock}
\end{textblock}}

\only<2>{\begin{textblock}{3}(12.4,4.45)
\begin{alertblock}{}
H$_0$: stationary
\end{alertblock}
\end{textblock}}

### Seasonal strength

STL decomposition: $y_t = T_t+S_t+R_t$

Seasonal strength $F_s = \max\big(0, 1-\frac{\text{Var}(R_t)}{\text{Var}(S_t+R_t)}\big)$

If $F_s > 0.64$, do one seasonal difference.

## Your turn

3. Do the unit root tests for the `Gas` series from `aus_accommodation`. Do they give the same numbers of difference as you chose?
