## Australian brick production

We will use the Bricks data from `aus_production` (Australian quarterly clay brick production 1956–-2005).

* Use an STL decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices. (Experiment with the seasonal window.)
* Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data.
* Use a naïve method to produce forecasts of the seasonally adjusted data.
* Use `decomposition_model()` to reseasonalise the results, giving forecasts for the original data.
* Repeat with a robust STL decomposition. Does it make much difference?

## Afghanistan population

The annual population of Afghanistan is available in the `global_economy` data set.

* Plot the data and comment on its features. Can you observe the effect of the Soviet-Afghan war?
* Fit a linear trend model and compare this to a piecewise linear trend model with knots at 1980 and 1989.
* Generate forecasts from these two models for the five years after the end of the data. Which looks better? Why?

## Olympic running times

Data set `olympic_running` contains the winning times (in seconds) in each Olympic Games sprint, middle-distance and long-distance track events from 1896 to 2016.

* Plot the winning time against the year for each event. Describe the main features of the plot.
* Fit a regression line to the data for each event. Obviously the winning times have been decreasing, but at what average rate per year?
* Predict the winning time for each race in the 2028 Olympics. Do they look reasonable?
* Adjust your model to make the trends piecewise linear. Do the forecasts look more reasonable?
