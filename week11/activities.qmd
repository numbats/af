1.  Fit a regression model with a piecewise linear trend with Fourier terms for the US leisure employment data.
    
    ```r
    leisure <- us_employment |>
      filter(
        Title == "Leisure and Hospitality",
        year(Month) > 2001
      ) |>
      mutate(Employed = Employed / 1000) |>
      select(Month, Employed)
    ```

2. Does the model fit well? What are the implications for forecasting?
3. Produce forecasts of US leisure employment using your best regression model.

4. Why don't you need to forecast the predictors?
