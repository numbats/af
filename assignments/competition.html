<p><strong>You must provide forecasts for the following items:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Google closing stock price on 24 March 2025 [<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/">Data</a>].</li>
<li>Maximum temperature at Melbourne airport on 14 April 2025 [<a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW3049.latest.shtml">Data</a>].</li>
<li>The difference in points (Collingwood minus Essendon) scored in the AFL match between Collingwood and Essendon for the Anzac Day clash. 25 April 2025 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Day_match">Data</a>].</li>
<li>The seasonally adjusted estimate of total employment for April 2025. ABS CAT 6202, to be released around mid May 2025 [<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release">Data</a>].</li>
<li>Google closing stock price on 26 May 2025 [<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/">Data</a>].</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For each of these, give a point forecast and an 80% prediction interval, and explain in a couple of sentences how each was obtained.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The [Data] links give you possible data to start with, but you are free to use any data you like.</li>
<li>There is no need to use any fancy models or sophisticated methods. Simple is better for this assignment. The methods you use should be understandable to any high school student.</li>
<li>Full marks will be awarded if you submit the required information, and are able to meaningfully justify your results in a sentence or two in each case.</li>
<li>Once the true values in each case are available, we will come back to this exercise and see who did the best using the scoring method described in class.</li>
<li>The student with the most accurate forecasts is the winner of our forecasting competition, and will win a $50 cash prize.</li>
<li>The assignment mark is not dependent on your score.</li>
</ul>
