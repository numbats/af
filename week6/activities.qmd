## Chinese GDP per capita forecasts

We will forecast the Chinese GDP from the `global_economy` data set using an ETS model. The following code provides a starting point. 

```{r}
library(fpp3)
chinese_gdp <- global_economy |> 
    filter(Country == "China") |>
    select(GDP_pc = GDP/Population)
chinese_gdp |> autoplot(GDP_pc)
fit <- chinese_gdp |>
    model(ets = ETS(GDP_pc ~ error("A") + trend("A", alpha = 0.3, beta = 0.3) ))
fit |>
    forecast(h=10) |>
    autoplot(chinese_gdp)
```

Experiment with the various options in the `ETS()` function to see how much the forecasts change with the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, with a damped trend, and with a Box-Cox transformation. Try to develop an intuition of what each is doing to the forecasts.

What happens when:

* $\alpha=0$ 
* $\alpha=1$ 
* $\beta=0$ 
* $\beta > $\alpha$
* Damping is added
* A strong transformation such as a logarithm (Box-Cox with $\lambda=0$ is used)

## Prediction interval calculation

For the no trend model, with $\alpha = 0.5$, find the 95% prediction intervals for the next five years.

Show that these are equal to $\ell_T \pm 1.96 \hat\sigma \sqrt{1+ (h-1)/4}$ where $\hat\sigma^2$ is the estimated residual variance.
