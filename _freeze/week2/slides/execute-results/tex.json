Use these functions to explore the quarterly tourism data for the Snowy Mountains.\n\n```r\nsnowy <- tourism |> filter(Region == \"Snowy Mountains\")\n```\n\nWhat do you learn?\n\n\n## Trend and seasonality in ACF plots\n\n- When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive.\n- When data are seasonal, the autocorrelations will be larger at the seasonal lags (i.e., at multiples of the seasonal frequency)\n- When data are trended and seasonal, you see a combination of these effects.\n\n\n## Which is which?\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](slides_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf){width=14.5cm}\n:::\n:::\n",
