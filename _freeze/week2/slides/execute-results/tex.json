Series can be stationary, trended or seasonal. They currently\nhave a large forecasting program written in-house but it doesn't seem\nto produce sensible forecasts.

Currently nearly 1\\% of GDP.\n  * The total cost is budgeted based on forecasts of drug usage.\n\n## CASE STUDY 2: PBS\n\n\\fullheight{pbs2}\n\n## CASE STUDY 2: PBS\n\n  * In 2001: \\$4.5 billion budget, under-forecasted by \\$800 million.\n  * Thousands of products. Seasonal demand.\n  * Subject to covert marketing, volatile products, uncontrollable expenditure.\n  * Although monthly data available for 10 years, data are aggregated to annual values, and only the first three years are used in estimating the forecasts.\n  * All forecasts being done with the \\texttt{FORECAST} function in MS-Excel!\n\n## CASE STUDY 3: Car fleet company\n\n**Client:** One of Australia's largest car fleet companies\n\n**Problem:** how to forecast resale value of vehicles? How\nshould this affect leasing and sales policies?\n\n\\pause\n\n### Additional information\n - They can provide a large amount of data on previous vehicles and their eventual resale values.\n - The resale values are currently estimated by a group of specialists. They see me as a threat and do not cooperate.\n\n## CASE STUDY 4: Airline\n\n\\fullheight{ansettlogo}\n\n## CASE STUDY 4: Airline\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](slides_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\only<2>{\\begin{textblock}{4.2}(11,5.5)\n\\begin{alertblock}{}\nNot the real data! Or is it?\n\\end{alertblock}\n\\end{textblock}}\n\n## CASE STUDY 4: Airline\n\n**Problem:** how to forecast passenger traffic on major routes?\n\n### Additional information\n\n  * They can provide a large amount of data on previous routes.\n  * Traffic is affected by school holidays, special events such as\nthe Grand Prix, advertising campaigns, competition behaviour, etc.\n  * They have a highly capable team of people who are able to do\nmost of the computing.\n\n## Seasonal or cyclic?\n\n\\alert{Differences between seasonal and cyclic patterns:}\n\n  * seasonal pattern constant length; cyclic pattern variable length\n  * average length of cycle longer than length of seasonal pattern\n  * magnitude of cycle more variable than magnitude of seasonal pattern\n\n\\pause\n\n\\begin{alertblock}{}\nThe timing of peaks and troughs is predictable with seasonal data, but unpredictable in the long term with cyclic data.\n\\end{alertblock}\n\n\n## Trend and seasonality in ACF plots\n\n- When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive.\n- When data are seasonal, the autocorrelations will be larger at the seasonal lags (i.e., at multiples of the seasonal frequency)\n- When data are trended and seasonal, you see a combination of these effects.\n\n## Your turn\n\nWe have introduced various functions for time series graphics include `autoplot()`, `gg_season()`, `gg_subseries()`, `gg_lag()` and `ACF`. Use these functions to explore the quarterly tourism data for the Snowy Mountains.\n\n```r\nsnowy <- tourism |> filter(Region == \"Snowy Mountains\")\n```\n\nWhat do you learn?\n\n\n## Which is which?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](slides_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){width=14.5cm}\n:::\n:::\n",
