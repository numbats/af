Here is some starting code with $c\\ne0$ and $d=0$:\n\n```r\nglobal_economy |>\n  filter(Country == \"Australia\") |>\n  model(ARIMA(Imports ~ 1 + pdq(d = 0))) |>\n  forecast(h = 50) |>\n  autoplot(global_economy)\n```\n\nFill in the table above with what you see in the forecast plot. What can you conclude about the effect of $c$ and $d$ on the long-term forecast mean and variance?\n\n\n## Simulate data from an AR(1) model\n\nUse the following R code to generate data from an AR(1) model with $\\phi_{1} = 0.6$ and $\\sigma^2=1$. The process starts with $y_1=0$.\n\n   ```r\n   y <- numeric(100)\n   e <- rnorm(100)\n   for(i in 2:100)\n     y[i] <- 0.6*y[i-1] + e[i]\n   sim <- tsibble(idx = seq_len(100), y = y, index = idx)\n   ```\n\nProduce a time plot for the series. How does the plot change as you change $\\phi_1$?\n\n## Simulate data from an MA(1) model\n\nWrite your own code to generate data from an MA(1) model with $\\theta_{1} = 0.6$ and $\\sigma^2=1$.\n\nProduce a time plot for the series. How does the plot change as you change $\\theta_1$?\n\n## Simulate data from an AR(2) model\n\nGenerate data from an AR(2) model with $\\phi_{1} = 1.35$, $\\phi_{2} = -0.75$ and $\\sigma^2=1$.\n\nWhat happens if you change $\\phi_2$ to $-0.45$? Why?\n\nWhat happens if you change $\\phi_1$ to $-0.25$? Why?\n",
