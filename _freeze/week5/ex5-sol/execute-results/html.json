However as it is the first lag, it is probable that there exists some real auto-correlation in the residuals that can be modelled.\n- The distribution appears normal.\n- The residual plot appears mostly random, however more observations appear to be above zero.

Explain your answer.\n>\n>   a. Good forecast methods should have normally distributed residuals.\n\n- False.\n- Although many good forecasting methods produce normally distributed residuals this is not required to produce good forecasts.\n- Other forecasting methods may use other distributions, it is just less common as they can be more difficult to work with.\n\n>   b. A model with small residuals will give good forecasts.\n\n- False.\n- It is possible to produce a model with small residuals by making a highly complicated (overfitted) model that fits the data extremely well.\n- This highly complicated model will often perform very poorly when forecasting new data.\n\n>   c. The best measure of forecast accuracy is MAPE.\n\n- False.\n- There is no single best measure of accuracy - often you would want to see a collection of accuracy measures as they can reveal different things about your residuals. MAPE in particular has some substantial disadvantages - extreme values can result when $y_t$ is close to zero, and it assumes that the unit being measured has a meaningful zero.\n\n>   d. If your model doesn’t forecast well, you should make it more complicated.\n\n- False.\n- There are many reasons why a model may not forecast well, and making the model more complicated can make the forecasts worse.\n- The model specified should capture structures that are evident in the data. Although adding terms that are unrelated to the structures found in the data will improve the model's residuals, the forecasting performance of the model will not improve.\n- Adding missing features relevant to the data (such as including a seasonal pattern that exists in the data) should improve forecast performance.\n\n>   e. Always choose the model with the best forecast accuracy as measured on the test set.\n\n- False.\n- There are many measures of forecast accuracy, and the appropriate model is the one which is best suited to the forecasting task. For instance, you may be interested in choosing a model which forecasts well for predictions exactly one year ahead. In this case, using cross-validated accuracy could be a more useful approach to evaluating accuracy.\n\n# fpp3 5.10, Ex 8\n\n> Consider the number of pigs slaughtered in New South Wales (data set `aus_livestock`).\n>\n>   a.
