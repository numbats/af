Try to develop an intuition of what each is doing to the forecasts.\n\n[Hint: use `h=20` when forecasting, so you can clearly see the differences between the various options when plotting the forecasts.]\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 3](../assignments/A3.qmd) is due on Friday 12 April.\n",
