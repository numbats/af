The following code provides a starting point. \n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](activities_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSeries: GDP_pc \nModel: ETS(A,A,N) \n  Smoothing parameters:\n    alpha = 0.3 \n    beta  = 0.3 \n\n  Initial states:\n        l[0]       b[0]\n 46231282116 2466843405\n\n  sigma^2:  9.10753e+22\n\n     AIC     AICc      BIC \n3303.588 3304.032 3309.769 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](activities_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nExperiment with the various options in the `ETS()` function to see how much the forecasts change with the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, with a damped trend, and with a Box-Cox transformation. Try to develop an intuition of what each is doing to the forecasts.\n\nWhat happens when:\n\n* $\\alpha=0$? \n* $\\alpha=1$? \n* $\\beta=0$? \n* $\\beta > $\\alpha$?\n* The trend is set to \"N\" (None)\n* The trend is set to \"Ad\" (Additive damped)\n* The error is set to \"M\" (Multiplicative)\n* A strong transformation such as a logarithm (Box-Cox with $\\lambda=0$ is used)?\n* $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are omitted?\n* The `trend()` term is omitted?\n* Everything from `~` on is omitted?\n\n## Prediction interval calculation\n\nFor the no trend model, with $\\alpha = 0.5$, find the 95% prediction intervals for the next five years. Use the `hilo()` function to calculate them from the `fc` object.\n\nShow that these are equal to $\\ell_T \\pm 1.96 \\hat\\sigma \\sqrt{1+ (h-1)/4}$ where $\\hat\\sigma^2$ is the estimated residual variance.\n\n* The `components()` function can give you the value of $\\ell_T$.\n* The `glance()` function can give you the value of $\\sigma^2$.\n",
