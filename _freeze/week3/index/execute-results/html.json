For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance.\n\n    * United States GDP from `global_economy`\n    * Slaughter of Victorian “Bulls, bullocks and steers” in `aus_livestock`\n    * Victorian Electricity Demand from `vic_elec`.\n    * Gas production from `aus_production`\n\n2. Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the `canadian_gas` data?\n\n3. Produce the following decomposition\n\n    ```r\n    canadian_gas |>\n      STL(Volume ~ season(window=7) + trend(window=11)) |>\n      autoplot()\n    ```\n\n4. What happens as you change the values of the two `window` arguments?\n\n5. How does the seasonal shape change over time? [Hint: Try plotting the seasonal component using `gg_season`.]\n\n6. Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series? [Hint: `season_adjust` is one of the variables returned by `STL`.]\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [Assignment 2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Friday 22 March.\n",
