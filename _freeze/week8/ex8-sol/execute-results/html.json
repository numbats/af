Why are the critical values at different distances from the mean of zero? Why are the autocorrelations different in each figure when they each refer to white noise?\n\n* The critical values are at different distances from zero because the data sets have different number of observations. The more observations in a data set, the less noise appears in the correlation estimates (spikes). Therefore the critical values for bigger data sets can be smaller in order to check if the data is not white noise.\n\n# fpp3 9.11, Ex2\n\n> A classic example of a non-stationary series are stock prices. Plot the daily closing prices for Amazon stock (contained in `gafa_stock`), along with the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngafa_stock |>\n  filter(Symbol == \"AMZN\") |>\n  mutate(t = row_number()) |>\n  update_tsibble(index = t) |>\n  gg_tsdisplay(Close, plot_type = \"partial\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ex8-sol_files/figure-html/ex2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe time plot shows the series \"wandering around\", which is a typical indication of non-stationarity. Differencing the series should remove this feature.\n\nACF does not drop quickly to zero, moreover the value $r_1$ is large and positive (almost 1 in this case). All these are signs of a non-stationary time series. Therefore it should be differenced to obtain a stationary series.\n\nPACF value $r_1$ is almost 1. All other values $r_i, i>1$ are small. This is a sign of a non-stationary process that should be differenced in order to obtain a stationary series.\n\n# fpp3 9.11, Ex3\n\n> For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation and order of differencing in order to obtain stationary data.\n\n>   a.
