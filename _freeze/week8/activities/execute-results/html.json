How has the tsibble been indexed? Why wouldn't `Date` be used for the index?\n\n2. See what currencies are included:\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   aud_xr |>\n     distinct(Currency, Description)\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n3. Choose a currency and plot its exchange rate using `gg_tsdisplay` like this. Does it look stationary?\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   aud_xr |>\n     filter(Currency == ???) |>\n     autoplot(Rate)\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n4. Now plot the first difference of the exchange rate. Does it look stationary?\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   aud_xr |>\n     filter(Currency == ???) |>\n     autoplot(difference(Rate))\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n5. Repeat for another couple of exchange rates. Does differencing always result in a stationary series? Why?\n\n6. If we used the `unitroot_ndiffs()` function, would it give the same answer?\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   aud_xr |>\n     features(Rate, unitroot_ndiffs)\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n## Tasmanian accommodation takings\n\nLet's extract the Tasmanian data from `aus_accommodation`. Check the help to see what this data set contains.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntas_takings <- aus_accommodation |>\n  filter(State == \"Tasmania\") |>\n  select(Takings)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will try to find transformations that make this series stationary.\n\n1. First, try to stabilise the variance using a Box-Cox transformation.\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   tas_takings |>\n     autoplot(\n       box_cox(Takings, lambda = ???)\n     )\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n2. Then, try to stabilise the mean using seasonal differencing.\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   tas_takings |>\n     autoplot(\n       box_cox(Takings, lambda = ???) |>\n       difference(lag = ???)\n     )\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n3. If that doesn't work, try a first difference as well.\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   tas_takings |>\n     autoplot(\n       box_cox(Takings, lambda = ???) |>\n       difference(lag = ???) |>\n       difference(lag = ???)\n     )\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n   The final transformed series should appear stationary.\n\n4. Check it's ACF.\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   tas_takings |>\n     ACF(\n       box_cox(Takings, lambda = ???) |>\n       difference(lag = ???) |>\n       difference(lag = ???)\n     ) |>\n     autoplot()\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n   What do you conclude?\n\n5. Now use the `unitroot_ndiffs` and `unitroot_nsdiffs` functions to check what differences they would suggest:\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   tas_takings |>\n     features(\n       box_cox(Takings, lambda = ???),\n       unitroot_nsdiffs\n     )\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   tas_takings |>\n     features(\n       box_cox(Takings, lambda = ???) |> difference(lag = ???),\n       unitroot_nsdiffs\n     )\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n   Does it suggest the same number of differencing as you did? Why/why not?\n",
