But it can capture a huge range of time series patterns.\n\n# Stationarity\n\n## Stationarity\n\\fontsize{14}{16}\\sf\n\\begin{block}{Definition}\nIf $\\{y_t\\}$ is a stationary time series, then for all $s$, the distribution of $(y_t,\\dots,y_{t+s})$ does not depend on $t$.\n\\end{block}\\pause\\vspace*{-0.3cm}\n\nTransformations help to **stabilize the variance**.\\newline\nFor ARIMA modelling, we also need to **stabilize the mean**.\n\n# Differencing\n\n### Differencing\n\n* Differencing helps to **stabilize the mean**.\n* First differencing: *change* between consecutive observations: $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$.\n* Seasonal differencing: *change* between years: $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-m}$.\n\n## Your turn\n\n1. Does differencing make the Closing stock price series stationary for Amazon and Apple stocks?\n2. What sorts of transformations and differencing are needed to make the `Gas` series from `aus_accommodation` stationary?\n\n\n## Automatic differencing\n\\fontsize{13}{16}\\sf\nStatistical tests to determine the required order of differencing.\n\n  1. Augmented Dickey Fuller test: null hypothesis is that the data are \\alert{non-stationary} and non-seasonal.\n  2. Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test: null hypothesis is that the data are \\alert{stationary} and non-seasonal.\n\n\\only<2>{\\begin{textblock}{4}(10.2,3.1)\n\\begin{alertblock}{}\nH$_0$: non-stationary\n\\end{alertblock}\n\\end{textblock}}\n\n\\only<2>{\\begin{textblock}{3}(12.4,4.45)\n\\begin{alertblock}{}\nH$_0$: stationary\n\\end{alertblock}\n\\end{textblock}}\n\n### Seasonal strength\n\nSTL decomposition: $y_t = T_t+S_t+R_t$\n\nSeasonal strength $F_s = \\max\\big(0, 1-\\frac{\\text{Var}(R_t)}{\\text{Var}(S_t+R_t)}\\big)$\n\nIf $F_s > 0.64$, do one seasonal difference.\n\n## Your turn\n\n3. Do the unit root tests for the `Gas` series from `aus_accommodation`. Do they give the same numbers of difference as you chose?\n",
