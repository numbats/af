Google closing stock price on 24 March 2025 [[Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)].\n  2. Maximum temperature at Melbourne airport on 14 April 2025 [[Data](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW3049.latest.shtml)].\n  3. The difference in points (Collingwood minus Essendon) scored in the AFL match between Collingwood and Essendon for the Anzac Day clash. 25 April 2025 [[Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Day_match)].\n  4. The seasonally adjusted estimate of total employment for April 2025. ABS CAT 6202, to be released around mid May 2025 [[Data](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release)].\n  5. Google closing stock price on 26 May 2025 [[Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)].\n\n**For each of these, give a point forecast and an 80% prediction interval, and explain in a couple of sentences how each was obtained.**\n\n* The [Data] links give you possible data to start with, but you are free to use any data you like.\n* There is no need to use any fancy models or sophisticated methods. Simple is better for this assignment. The methods you use should be understandable to any high school student.\n* Full marks will be awarded if you submit the required information, and are able to meaningfully justify your results in a sentence or two in each case.\n* Once the true values in each case are available, we will come back to this exercise and see who did the best using the scoring method described in class.\n* The student with the most accurate forecasts is the winner of our forecasting competition, and will win a $50 cash prize.\n* The assignment mark is not dependent on your score.\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 7
