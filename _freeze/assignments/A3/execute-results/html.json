Each student will use a different time series, selected using their student ID number as follows.\n\n```r\nlibrary(fpp3)\nget_my_data <- function(student_id) {\n  set.seed(student_id)\n  all_data <- readr::read_rds(\"https://bit.ly/monashretaildata\")\n  while(TRUE) {\n    retail <- filter(all_data, `Series ID` == sample(`Series ID`, 1))\n    if(!any(is.na(fill_gaps(retail)$Turnover))) return(retail)\n  }\n}\n# Replace the argument with your student ID\nretail <- get_my_data(12345678)\n```\n\nUse a training set up to and including 2018.\n\n* What transformations (Box-Cox and/or differencing) would be required to make the data stationary? You should use a unit-root test as part of the discussion.\n* Use a plot of the ACF and PACF of the (possibly differenced) data to determine two plausible models for this data set.\n* Fit both models, along with an automatically chosen model, and produce forecasts for 2019--2022.\n* Which model is best based on AIC? Which model is best based on the test set RMSE? Which do you think is best to use for future forecasts? Why?\n* Check the residuals from your preferred model, using an ACF plot and a Ljung-Box test. Do the residuals appear to be white noise?\n\nSubmit a Quarto (`qmd`) file which carries out the above analysis. You need to submit one file which implements all steps above. You may use <a href=\"https://github.com/numbats/af/raw/main/assignments/Assignment_template.qmd\">this file</a> as a starting point.\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 16 May 2025</b><br><a href=https://learning.monash.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=3444032 class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Submit</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a>\n",
