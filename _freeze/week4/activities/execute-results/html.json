Which do you think is best? Why?\n\n## Australian brick production\n\nWe will use the Bricks data from `aus_production` (Australian quarterly clay brick production 1956–-2005).\n\n* Use an STL decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices. (Experiment with the seasonal window.)\n* Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data.\n* Use a naïve method to produce forecasts of the seasonally adjusted data.\n* Use `decomposition_model()` to reseasonalise the results, giving forecasts for the original data.\n* Repeat with a robust STL decomposition. Does it make much difference?\n\n## Afghanistan population\n\nThe annual population of Afghanistan is available in the `global_economy` data set.\n\n* Plot the data and comment on its features. Can you observe the effect of the Soviet-Afghan war?\n* Fit a linear trend model and compare this to a piecewise linear trend model with knots at 1980 and 1989.\n* Generate forecasts from these two models for the five years after the end of the data. Which looks better? Why?\n\n## Olympic running times\n\nData set `olympic_running` contains the winning times (in seconds) in each Olympic Games sprint, middle-distance and long-distance track events from 1896 to 2016.\n\n* Plot the winning time against the year for each event. Describe the main features of the plot.\n* Fit a regression line to the data for each event. Obviously the winning times have been decreasing, but at what average rate per year?\n* Predict the winning time for each race in the 2028 Olympics. Do they look reasonable?\n* Adjust your model to make the trends piecewise linear. Do the forecasts look more reasonable?\n\n",
