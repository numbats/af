Try forecasting the Chinese GDP from the `global_economy` data set using an ETS model.

Experiment with the various options in the `ETS()` function to see how much the forecasts change with damped trend, or with a Box-Cox transformation. Try to develop an intuition of what each is doing to the forecasts.

[Hint: use `h=20` when forecasting, so you can clearly see the differences between the various options when plotting the forecasts.]
